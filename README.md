## web-app-boilerplate
# Welcome to my Web App Boilerplate! 
I use this boilerplate as a starting point for any browser-based application. 
Built on Node.js, the boilerplate is easily extensible to include additional 
node packages. 

### This simple boilerplate includes:
- [**Express.js**]("https://expressjs.com/") as a web-app framework. Express 
handles routing http requests and integrates with Pug, Mustache, or EJS 
template engines. 
- [**Pug.js**]("https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html") as a template 
engine. This boilerplate uses Pug.js as it's template engine, which easily 
integrates with the Express.js framework.
- [**Bootstrap**]("https://getbootstrap.com/") front-end css and component 
library. Bootstrap easily provides responsive styles and UI comonents.
- [**Cucumber.js**]("https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js") behavior driven 
testing framework. Cucumber lets you write tests in plain language, allowing 
tests to be used as a communication tool across the team.
