## web-app-boilerplate
# Welcome to my Web App Boilerplate! 
I use this boilerplate as a starting point for any browser-based application. 
Built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the boilerplate is easily extended 
to include additional node packages. 

I built this for my personal convenience. However, if you like what you see, 
I encourage you to use it as a starting point for your web project. It is 
[Unlicenced](/LICENSE), and free to take and use for any purpose. If you do 
decide to start with my boilerplate, I would love to see what you build!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin developing with the Web App Boilerplate, you will need to have 
a few things setup:
1. Download and install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
2. Clone or download the Web App Boilerplate repo.
3. Navigate to the project root and enter run `npm install -d` (or 
    `npm install`). This will install all of the required development 
    dependencies. (See [Adding an npm Package]() to add your own packages to the
    boilerplate.)

**This simple boilerplate includes the following npm packages by default:**
- [**Express.js**]("https://expressjs.com/") as a web-app framework. Express 
handles routing http requests and integrates with Pug, Mustache, or EJS 
template engines. 
- [**Pug.js**]("https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html") as a template 
engine. This boilerplate uses Pug.js as it's template engine, which easily 
integrates with the Express.js framework.
- [**Bootstrap**]("https://getbootstrap.com/") front-end css and component 
library. Bootstrap easily provides responsive styles and UI components.
- [**Cucumber.js**]("https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js") behavior driven 
testing framework. Cucumber lets you write tests in plain language, allowing 
tests to be used as a communication tool across the team. 

Finally, you will need a JavaScript code editor. I recommend 
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because it is free, although any text 
editor or JavaScript IDE will work.(If you use VSCode you can install 
additional extensions for JavaScript and Cucumber/Gherkin to make development 
easier.)
